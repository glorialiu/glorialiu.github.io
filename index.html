		<h2>San Francisco</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I am living in San Francisco for the summer, in the touristy but hippie neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury. During the day I work as a software engineering intern at Twitter, and in the evening and weekends I enjoy exploring the city and unwinding with climbing and yoga.  </p>

		<h2>San Luis Obispo</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>This fall I will be starting my senior year at Cal Poly SLO, and it will be the last year of four that I will call this college town home. While I have loved my time on the central coast of California, I am excited to graduate in the Spring of 2018 with a BS in Computer Science. Cal Poly's computer science department and professors are amazing and it is where my excitement about technology and computer science began and grew. Cal Poly is also where my love for the outdoors grew as well -- I was introduced to cycling by the Cal Poly Triathlon team, and hiking seems to be everyone's favorite activity here.</p>

			<h2>Sacramento</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I spent the summer after my sophomore year living in Folsom, a suburb outside Sacramento. I was working as a software engineering intern at Intel. As my first internship, it was a summer full of new experiences - I learned an incredible amount from my very knowledgeable team, the other interns, and also from the Windows drivers books I spent hours poring over. Upon first moving there I thought I could never enjoying living in a somewhat desolate place like that, but eventually it warmed on me (really warmed, over 100 degrees Fahrenheit every day warm). Some of my favorite memories are bouldering at Granite Arch in Rancho Cordova with the other interns most days after work, and paddleboarding on the American River. </p>
				</div>

			<h2>Seattle</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I grew up and spent most of childhood in Seattle, Washington. For those that are actually from the area - not really Seattle, but Redmond. Even though I am rarely back now, I always enjoy coming home and being in the rain.. but only for a little bit. :) </p>
